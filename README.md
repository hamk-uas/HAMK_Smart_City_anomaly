# HAMK Smart City project - Anomaly detection in HVAC building data.
This is a repository include Python3 scripts and Python Notebook for anomaly detection in Smart City project. The Smart City project of HÃ¤me Universty of Applied Sciences focuses on promoting low-carbon developments through imlementation of Artificial Intelligence. The content of this repository is focused on anomaly detection on heating energy consumption of HVAC system control.

## Installation

Install required python libraries by using requirements.txt

>pip install -r requirements.txt


## Code run

Need to keep data and file in the same folder to run the Python scripts.

## Overview of files

* PCA_Anomaly.py - Python script for anomaly detection using PCA and Quartile based method.

* PCA_Anomaly.ipynb - Notebook for identification of anomaly using PCA and Quartile based method. Step-by-step explanation and visualization have performed.

* PCA_Anomaly_res.py - Python script for identification of anomaly using PCA and residual based method.

* PCA_Anomaly_res_tuning.py - Fine tuned code for PCA and residual based method for the identification of anomaly using best components.

* PCA_Anomaly_res_tuning_work.py - PCA and residual based method for anomaly detection trained on clean data and testing on manually contaminated data.
